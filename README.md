Random Forest:
It is a Supervised Machine Learning method which arrive at a single outcome, it aggregates the results of various decision trees and makes use of ensemble learning.

Clustering:
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique in which the algorithm groups similar data points together based on their features. The goal of clustering is to identify patterns and structure in data that may not be immediately apparent to the human eye.

Image Classification:
Image classification is a type of supervised machine learning technique used to categorize images into different classes or categories based on their visual features. It involves training a model to learn patterns and features in images and then using that model to predict the class of new images.
